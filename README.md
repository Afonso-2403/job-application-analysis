## Setup
The setup to access Google Sheets through this app was the [one available on gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/oauth2.html#enable-api-access-for-a-project) with the OAuth Client ID option.

The credentials are stored locally in the .config directory, and the only user with access to this project is me.
